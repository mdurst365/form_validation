# Client-Side Form Validation

Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure that the user has filled out all required form controls and done so in the correct format. Knowing that this is a common use of JavaScript, I wanted to make sure that I received additional practice outside of the OSU coding bootcamp. Therefore I followed a tutorial to help me reinforce my form validation skills.

# Some topics covered in this tutorial included:
- HTML form elements
- CSS absolute and relative positioning of elements
- Client-side form validation with JS
- JS error messages (without any prompts or alerts)
- Dynamically inserting classes with JS

# Preview will go here when tutorial is completed:
